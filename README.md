#Users can add locations where they place certain objects they do not want to lose (For example: Twice on the table, three times on the key hanger next to the main entrance, once on the edge of the dining room table) and once 2 or more places have been inputted it will tell you the statistics of where to look for that object in order from most likely to least likely.
